            Elderly Women: The Overlooked Face of Ageing
        </h1>
        <p class="para">
            As Odishaâ€™s population ages, elderly women emerge as one of the most vulnerable groups, facing 
            compounded disadvantages of gender, age, and poverty. Despite gradual improvements in literacy 
            and longevity, many continue to lack financial independence, access to healthcare, and decision-
            making power. Their longer life expectancy, coupled with lower education and income levels, 
            places them at greater risk of social isolation, ill health, and neglect.
            <br>
            The literacy rate among the elderly persons in Odisha has increased from 27% in 1991 to 44% in 
            2011. However, over 50% remain illiterate, which affects their ability to access services effectively. 
            The literacy rate among elderly women (24%) is less than half that of elderly men (63%), as females 
            face social, economic and educational disadvantages from an early age, which profoundly impacts their 
            later years. Despite well-intentioned efforts, elderly women often remain secondary in many aspects of 
            life, with limited autonomy in making choices about their futures. Their economic condition is concerning, 
            with only 10% of elderly women in rural areas and 11% in urban areas being economically independent. 
            In contrast, elderly men fare significantly better, with 48% in rural areas and 57% in urban areas 
            achieving economic independence.
            <br>
            According to the SRS 2016-2020, the life expectancy at birth in Odisha was 71.4 years for females compared 
            to 69.1 years for males. At age 60, the average remaining life expectancy was found to be about 23.2 years 
            (22.6 for males and 23.7 for females), while at 70, it was 16.1 years (15.6 for males and 16.6 for females). 
            With the rise in life expectancy at birth, women are expected to live longer than their male counterparts, 
            both nationally and in Odisha. This is reflected in the higher number of widows as compared to widowers 
            in old age. Additionally, the proportion of elderly women residing in the homes of others is more than twice 
            that of elderly men. The percentage of elderly women living alone, excluding those in institutional care 
            facilities, is also significantly higher than that of elderly men. 
            <br>
            With higher life expectancy, women also face greater healthcare challenges, particularly related to 
            menopause, which brings significant hormonal changes and associated health issues. Other health concerns 
            for older women include cancer, heart disease, osteoarthritis, diabetes, hypertension, and mental health issues, 
            among others. Notably, the incidence of dementia is higher among elderly women than men. These issues require 
            special focus and attention in policy planning and implementation.
