            Changing Trends and Regional Patterns of Inter-<br>State In-Migration to Odisha
        </h1>
        <p class="para">
            The migration pattern of interstate in-migration to the state noted a significant change 
            between 2007-08 and 2020-21. In 2007-08, 33% and 26.7% of interstate in-migration were 
            urban-urban and rural-urban streams, respectively. PLFS 2020-21 estimates reveal a sharp 
            increase in urban-rural stream, which is mostly because of an increase in return migration to 
            rural areas of the state during this period. In 2020-21, 57.9% of the interstate migration to 
            the state belonged to the urban-rural and more than 80% of the stream was composed of return 
            migrants, whose usual place of residence was Odisha at one point in time in the past. A further 
            disaggregation indicates that this urban-rural stream is solely male-dominated, indicating a 
            reverse labour migration. Such reverse migration to rural areas of the state is worrisome as 
            it may increase pressure on the state’s already labour-surplus rural economy.

                Regional Patterns
            </i>
        </h4>
        <p class="para">
            PLFS 2020-21 estimates show that migration rates, particularly among men, were higher in 
            Odisha's Coastal and Southern regions. Notably, the Southern region, which includes 
            out-migration-prone KBK districts (Kandhamal, Baudh, Subarnapur, Balangir, Nuapada, Kalahandi, 
            Rayagada, Nabarangapur, Koraput, and Malkangiri), had the lowest migration rate in 2007-08. 
            However, by 2020-21, migration in this region saw a significant rise, accounting for half of 
            the state's inter-state migration, largely due to return migration. Overall, the majority of 
            the inter-state migrants to Odisha originated in three southern states, i.e., Kerala, Tamil 
            Nadu and Andhra Pradesh and a considerable share of these in-migrants were return migrants. 
            This suggests a shift toward long-term circular migration, where migrants return home after 
            completing their work cycle, as these states deny these migrants long-term opportunities.

                Reasons for Migration
            </i>
        </h4>
        <p class="para">
            PLFS 2020-21 reveals that only 30.8% of male inter-state migrants in Odisha moved for 
            employment reasons, much lower than the national average of 52.5%. Employment-related migration 
            has declined in both rural and urban areas since 2007-08, suggesting the state's limited 
            ability to attract labour from outside. Additionally, 18% of male migrants cited "loss of 
            employment" as the reason for migration. This is particularly evident among rural migrants 
            (21.4%) and return migrants (22%), indicating growing difficulty in securing employment in 
            other states. ‘Employment-related’ reasons seem to be still important for in-migration to 
            urban areas. However, the figure for employment-related migration among males in the urban 
            areas has declined from 82.1% to 59.4% between 2007-08 and 2020-21. This is an indication that 
            the urban areas of the state are unable to create new opportunities to attract migrants from 
            other states. ‘Marriage’ and ‘migration of parents/earning members’ are the two major reasons 
            for inter-state female migration in Odisha, particularly when the destination is urban.

                Characteristics of In-migrants
            </i>
        </h4>
        <p class="para">
            PLFS 2020-21 shows that Odisha's inter-state in-migrants are primarily young males, 
            with 36.5% aged 15-29 and 39.6% aged 30-44, surpassing national figures. The share of young 
            male migrants (15-29) has increased significantly since 2007-08. Female in-migrants tend to be 
            older, with 25% aged 45-59. Odisha mainly attracts less-educated migrants, particularly in 
            rural areas, with 67.3% of inter-state in-migrants having education only up to middle school, 
            much higher than the national average. Only 11.7% of migrants to Odisha had higher education, 
            though this share is higher in urban areas (24.4%) and among female migrants (18.1%).
